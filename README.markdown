# Algorithms' implementations in Python

The aim of this project is to implement in Python some algorithms I've studied.

## selection

Algorithms for finding the kth smallest number in a list (the kth order statistic). This includes the cases of finding the minimum, maximum, and median elements.

* kth_by_extreme            O(kn)
* kth_by_sorting            O(nlogn)
* kth_by_median_of_medians  O(n)
* kth_random_pivot          O(n)
